                        <h2>About Banasthali Vidyapith</h2>
                        
                        <p>The name ‘Banasthali Vidyapith’ was adopted only in 1943. This also happened to be the year when undergraduate courses were first introduced. The institution was granted the status of a deemed university in 1983 by the UGC. Prof. Sushila Vyas , the first student of Banasthali Vidyapith  was appointed the first Director of Vidyapith. The UGC committee which recommended the conferment of University status on the institution kept the following points in mind: (i) Vidyapith’s definite and viable programme for restructuring courses at the undergraduate level and its eagerness to carry out various measures to make education more meaningful and practical, (ii) availability of  opportunities to the students to develop their personalities, and (iii) Vidyapith’s initiative to inculcate spiritual and moral values in the students through various activities, emphasizing character-building and simplicity. With its autonomous status, the institute could now experiment, innovate and formulate its own curriculum and other activities.
                        </p>

                       <p> Under the tutelage of the Shastri family, Banasthali Vidyapith has grown from a school catering to only 6 students to the only residential women institute in the country that provides education to girls from the pre-primary stage up to the Doctoral level ( Date-Line of growth of Banasthali Vidyapith )  Banasthali Vidyapith has been accredited by National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) with ‘A’ Grade (Five star Rating).

                        <p>Banasthali Vidyapith offers Undergraduate and Postgraduate programmes in various faculties. Each faculty has number of departments under it and normally the programmes running under the departments in a faculty have an interdisciplinary approach in theory as well as in practical. The design and implementation of each programme strengthens the University's philosophy of carving the student's personality.</p>
<p>Curricula are generally framed, assessed and upgraded following the universally accepted standard procedures giving top priorities to regional and national interests as well as to the current trends of different disciplines. Designing of curricula starts from the Board of Studies of every discipline. It is then critically analyzed in the respective faculty and is recommended to the Academic Council for its critical analysis and approval. As a consequence of this, easy and fast implementation of the newly designed and upgraded curricula is possible. Usually the changes made in the curricula are implemented during the following academic year.</p>

<p>Since its inception as a university in the year 1983, Banasthali Vidyapith has always been on the march of introducing new programmes of relevance to women students. The curricular changes are always made by taking into consideration both conceptual and practical aspects of the subject. It is very well reflected in the choice of foundation programmes and the introduction of vocational programmes at the graduate level. Besides, introduction and successful implementation of Post Graduate programmes in emerging areas such as  M.Tech. (Remote Sensing), M.Tech. (VLSI Design), M.Des., M.Sc. (Bio-Informatics), MBA (Aviation Management),  M.Sc. (Electronics),  M.Sc. (Bio-Technology), MCA and  MBA; programmes of interdisciplinary nature such as M.Sc.(Mathematical Sciences-specialization in Theoretical Computer Science), M.Phil in Social Sciences and introduction of innovative teacher education programmes based on constructionist view (B.Ed.-Education) are examples worth mentioning.</p>

                            <p>Research has been an integral component of the higher education in Banasthali even before its attainment of Deemed University status. However, initially it was mainly in the form of Doctoral studies. Over the past ten years, the research efforts have expanded to include sponsored research and consultancy projects in various disciplines. A noteworthy development in this direction has been  the recent  sanction of a Centre for Research in Mathematical Sciences to Banasthali University by the department of Science & Technology, Government of India. Such Centres are few, probably one or two in the country. Establishment of the centre is definitly going to boost the research environment not only of Banasthali but in the entire region of the state.Few other worth mentioning recent projects are:</p>

                    <strong>Informal Education Center</strong><br>
                    The informal education center has been in existence since the inception of Banasthali University. It has been carrying out the work of education and training of rural women since then. The development of villages has always been integral to the vision and philosophy of Banasthali. In fact, the origin of Banasthali was for social service and for making villages self-sufficient. Women from the villages come to the informal education center for getting education and for being trained in various tasks.
